# Acme-Shopping-Mall-A-Hierarchical-Cluster-Analysis-of-Customers
#### Using hierarchical cluster analysis in R, we identified three customer segments for Acme Shopping. To better understand how they responded and to potentially create a customer profile for each segment, we calculated the mean responses to the questions for each cluster

## Conclusions
#### We identified three customer segments:

#### ● Recreational shoppers who enjoy shopping and are not highly price conscious.
#### ● Functional shoppers who likely shop out of necessity.
#### ● Price-sensitive customers who are interested in deals, discounts, and sales.

## Recommendations
#### This cluster analysis does not include information about respondents’ age, gender or other factors related to shopping behavior. To better understand Acme Shopping customers, we recommend conducting a deeper analysis of each segment. For example, why are Cluster 2 customers less engaged? There may be specific factors or pain points contributing to their disengagement. Addressing these issues could encourage more engagement and shopping, especially since they are not as price-sensitive as Cluster 3.
#### Based on the findings at this stage, we can assume that Cluster 2 customers are functional shoppers who spend less time shopping and don’t enjoy it. They are not regular visitors. For these customers, the shopping mall could consider online shopping with free delivery, targeting their preference for convenience and functionality.
#### For Cluster 3 customers, the shopping mall could develop special seasonal promotions and discounts.
#### The most stable and frequent shoppers in Cluster 1 are important. The mall could consider special loyalty programs and events for these customers, as they like the overall idea of shopping experience and enjoy it. Their expected behavior includes regular visits and a prioritization of experience over cost.
